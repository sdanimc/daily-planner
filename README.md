Users are presented with an up-to-date day month and date at the top of the page.
Each hour of the work day is presented as a box. If the box is gray, it has passed, while green boxes are in the future. The current hour is in red making it easy to find.
Users can click on any box and type to enter or edit text for the hour. Users must click the save button on the right or the inputted text will be lost when the page is reloaded.
